# Prompting Scenarios

This 
1. Error - whats the fix
2. Question - natural langauge to some kind of result
3. What to do next - takes the last couple commands as context to see what may be a best next step
4. Analyze and Improve - given a script path, tell me how I can improve this code with different metrics (preformance, comments, line number etc)
5. Script Builder - similiar to function builder for PowerShellAI but not exclusive to functions.
6. Generative Notebook experience - like the current web ChatGPT version however you can run the commands inline and get the results or edit it in real time
7. Setting particular session with custom prompts/roles (New-Chat in PowerShellAI) 


- think about timeout
- Take other stuff from UI
