# Shell Integration Module

The AISH module is a PowerShell module that creates a connection between PowerShell 7 and AISH. It
allows for deeper integration with PowerShell 7's interactive ecosystem such as predictive
intellisense. It also allows for cross pane communication between the AISH agent and the PowerShell
to send queries, errors, and results between the two shells.
